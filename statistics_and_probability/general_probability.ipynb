    "There are 50 cards of 5 different colors. It comprises of 10 Red cards, 10 blue cards, 10 orange cards, 10 green cards and 10 yellow cards. Each color will have the cards numbered between 1 to10. You pick 2 cards at random. What is the probability that they are not of same color and not of same number.  \n",

    "Given your card, whatever color and type (say red and 5), you now have 49 card remaining, 9 red, 4 fives, and the rest unchanged.  The probability of the next card being not red and not a five is P(~red, ~5 | remaining cards).  Red and 5 are not dependant in this case so we can break this into P(~red | remaining cards) * P(~5 | remaining cards).\n",
