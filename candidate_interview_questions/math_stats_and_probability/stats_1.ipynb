    "A p-value is the probability, under the null-hypothesis, of seeing a result as extreme or more extreme than the one seen.  \n",
    "In our case, hte # of heads in coin flips is binomial, with the null-hypothesis of a fair-coin stating P(heads) = 0.5.\n",

    "A one-sided test would state that the p-value is = \n",

    "P-value = bino(10,8)*0.5^8*0.5^2 + bino(10,9)*0.5^9*0.5^1 + bino(10,10)*0.5^10\n",

    "The heuristic, magic number for rejecting null-hypothesis is P-value < 0.05.  We didn't cross that threshold, but it's close.\n",
