    "We can solve this with dynamic programming.  We'll walk through the sorted arrays, we keep track of the smallest range with all the elements we've found so far.\n",

    "A prioroty queue, with one element from each list will allow us to get the smallest (or largest) element from the current range we're in.  When we pop this element form the queue, we test the range from that smallest element and the largest element in the  set (which we have to keep track of before we insert it, since the queue only guarentees fast access to the smallest).  \n",

    "## Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "For each elements in all of the lists, we have to push them into the queue (which costs log(m), where m is the size of the queue).  So, it's going to cost us nLog(m) in time.  The queue will cost us m extra space.\n",
