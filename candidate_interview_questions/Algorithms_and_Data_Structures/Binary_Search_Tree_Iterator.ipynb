    "The \"average\" runtime of O(1) implies that we traverse the tree one time, because, for a tree of size N, to exhaust the iterator we have to call BSTI.next() N times.  N/N = 1 gives us our \"average\" runtime of O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "The memory of O(h) implies that we need some extra data-structure that is at max, the height of the three.  We're probably creating a queue or a stack.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we known the data-structure is a BST, it has the propeties that all nodes to the left have values lower than the current node, and all nodes to the right have values greater than the current node.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, at any given node, we can find the next smallest number by recursing node.left until we hit the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create the iterator with a \"push_all\" function, that does the above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next function will get the item at the top of the stack, check if it has an item to the right, if it does, push_all on that item to add all those children of the current node to the stack.  Then return the next item that was pulled out."
