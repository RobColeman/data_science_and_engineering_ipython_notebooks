    "If we're assuming we're in a plane, with x,y pair positions, and our distances are in i_delta_j_x, i_delta_j_y) pairs, we can solve this arbitrarily by setting one of the gas stations, station i, to position (0,0), and do a single pass through the distance matrix to compute the locations from station j with (0+i_delta_j_x, 0+i_delta_j_y).\n",

    "We only need one pass through the distances between station_0 and station_i, for each i in the n stations.  So, it's going to cost O(n) computation.  The needed memory depends on how we represent our output, but if we're just providing positions, then we need O(n) space for an array of x,y coordinated per n stations."
