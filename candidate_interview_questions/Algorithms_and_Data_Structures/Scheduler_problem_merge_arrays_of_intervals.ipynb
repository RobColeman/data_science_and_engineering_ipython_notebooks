    "much like merging sorted arrays of numbers, we can walk both arrays, and merge them in linear time.  At the first step, we take the next interval with the earliest start time and add it to the output.  At all remaining steps, we find the next unused interval with the earliest start time.  If it's start time is earlier than the last output interval end time, we replace that last output intervals end time with the max(last_output_end, next_interval_end).  We repeat until all of the intervals have been added."
