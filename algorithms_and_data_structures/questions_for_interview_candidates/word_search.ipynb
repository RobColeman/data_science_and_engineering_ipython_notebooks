    "Given a starting index to check, checking in every direction is a recursive DFS in all four direction, except the direction we came from.  So, we can start by building this recusive DFS method.  For each recursive call, we have to keep track of the direction we came from, the index we've stepped towards, and the remaining part of the word.  If we make a recursive call with an empty word remainder, we've satisfied the search.  If the letter at the new index doesn't match the word remainders next letter, we've failed in this path of the DFS and can return False from this call.  Lastly, we have to keep track of the edges of the board, and not search out of bounds.\n",
