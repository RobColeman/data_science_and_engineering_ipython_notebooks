    "We need to touch every point once, so that's at least O(N).  \n",
    "Inserting into our solution set could cost O(m) to maintain order.\n",
    "In the worst case, keeping a large number of the points, in a set of points with descending distance, we'd have to insert every new point, and maintain order in our solition set.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the solution costs O(n X m), but in most cases the m portion is insignificant compared to n, so it would be O(n)\n",

    "We also need to keep our solution set in memory, but no more, so the space complexity is O(m)"
